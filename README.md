# CHIPS
The CHIPS Kawari Template is an Ukagaka/Ghost template for the programming language Kawari.<br>
Kawari is a programming language popular in many early Japanese Ghosts, however it has seen little use in the English community due to the prominence of YAYA.<br>
This template is intended to provide a unique option out of the currently available English templates, which currently require a substantial amount of programming knowledge to use.<br>
CHIPS is designed as a 'middleware', which means there is a layer of software which interprets the events one's baseware sends to the Ghost. This allows the User to focus primarily on writing dialogue and not code.<br>
