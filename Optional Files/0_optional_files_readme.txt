This little folder holds optional files for you to drop in your Ghost, such as extra scripts, new functions, and things like that.
They're not necessarily any more complicated than what's contained in CHIPS by default. It's more about keeping the main core of CHIPS easy to use and customize.
Unlike most other facets of CHIPS, the optional files are not intended to be drag and drop. To use the optional files as intended, copy and paste the code you need from the optional file to an appropriate '.kis' file in the Ghost. The placement is arbitrary and based entirely upon where you'd like them to go.
There's extra information on each in their respective files, so give them a look!
