Hello! This is the CHIPS Kawari Template. You are currently on '1.0.0'.
CHIPS is unique in that it acts as a middleman between you, and the SHIORI. You shouldn't have to know any Kawari to use CHIPS, although, to the make the most use of it, knowing a little helps.

Let me introduce you to the files you can see in this folder. I suggest pulling up the folder you found this file in and looking at it as I do so.

ghost (folder) - The programming for the Ghost. The 'master' folder is what actually holds all the programming. You'll primarily be working here.

shell (folder) - The artwork for the Ghost. the 'master' folder here is the default artwork, while 'n_basic' is an example of how to include multiple shells in your Ghost.

CHIPS Readme.txt - The file you're reading! Can be deleted when you're done with it.

developer_options.txt- This file makes packing up your Ghost for distribution easier. But if you're having issues with it, go ahead and delete it. All it does is tell SSP (a Ghost baseware) to ignore your save data when packing up your Ghost. (OPTIONAL)

install.txt - Information about your Ghost so the baseware knows how to install it.

readme.txt - A text file that will pop up when your Ghost is installed. Make sure to fill it out!

thumbnail.png - An image file that will show up when your Ghost's name is hovered over in the Call/Change Ghost menu option. Very helpful for distinguishing Ghosts when you have a lot of them. (OPTIONAL)

thumbnail.pna - An image file that informs the transparency of 'thumbnail.png'. If you  want transparency in your thumbnail, you'll need to make a '.pna' file to go with it! (OPTIONAL)

Don't worry if you don't totally get it. If you don't know where to start, I suggest moving onto the 'ghost\master' folder. You'll find the next readme there!
If you want to start with artwork, as I understand a lot of people interested in Ghosts come in as artists, you can also start in the 'shell\master' folder.
