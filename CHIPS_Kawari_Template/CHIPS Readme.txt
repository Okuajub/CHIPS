Hello! This is the CHIPS Kawari Template.
CHIPS is unique in that it acts as a middleman between you, and the SHIORI. You shouldn't have to know any Kawari to use CHIPS, although to the make the most use of it knowing a little helps.

You may have noticed the "developer_options.txt"- this is an optional file which makes packing up your Ghost for distribution easier, but if you're having issues with it, go ahead and delete it. All it attempts to do is tell SSP to ignore save data when preparing the Ghost for distribution.

With that out of the way... If you don't know where to start, I suggest moving onto the 'ghost\master' folder. You'll find the next readme there!
