Hello! This is the CHIPS Kawari Template.
CHIPS is unique in that it acts as a middleman between you, and the SHIORI. You shouldn't have to know any Kawari to use CHIPS, although to the make the most use of it knowing a little helps.
If you don't know where to start, I suggest moving onto the 'ghost\master' folder. You'll find the next readme there!

Also, the license.txt may seem scary, but it's OK. It's included in every copy of CHIPS distributed by me, and it is not intended nor needed to be included with your Ghost. The following explanation is not legal advice. 
It's purpose is to allow me the ability to make sure that my code is not reproduced in whole for commercial purposes without my permission, and to protect myself (and you!) legally. The license also reaffirms my ownership of the images distributed in this Ghost.
I am very lenient on what "substantial portions of the Software" means, and you may remove this license when redistributing your own Ghost. In fact, I highly encourage you to remove it due to the fact the licensor is attributed to me.

If you would like to use a similar license, the license used for CHIPS (the software) is the MIT License modified by the Commons Clause.
