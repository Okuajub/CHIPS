# Miscelleaneous Events
#--
# There's many events which are not necessarily needed for Ghost functioning, and this is the file that holds them, here.
# Also an ideal place for optional file snippets to go.
# If you can't think of anything for your character to say with these, don't worry about it.
# They've been made neutral on purpose so they can be left alone.

# Some events which do this are checking your email, and fixing the clock.

# These dialogues occur for Network updates, where your Ghost finds update files from the web.
# Reference 0 is the name of your Ghost. You don't have to use it, though.
