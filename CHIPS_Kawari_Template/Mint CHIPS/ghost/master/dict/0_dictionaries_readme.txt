Hey there! So, you're looking to get into the coding side of things, are you? Or, maybe you're just here to study the code! Which, is totally fine by me.
These aren't heavily commented by any means, and follow the 'middleware' structure that original Ghosts don't tend to follow. So I don't necessarily recommend using CHIPS as a heavy reference. 
But, it's still Kawari code written in English, so there's some value in that.
In any case, good luck with whatever you're looking for in here.
